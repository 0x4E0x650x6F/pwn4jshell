# pwn4jshell
Java Web shell project

Idea of creating, webshell with suport to old versions of java. 
Building it in jsp means the code compilation will happend at the server side
with the server compiler, making it easyer and less likely to run into
compatibility issues. 
Other than api... and sintax things should be easy. 


## Credits
